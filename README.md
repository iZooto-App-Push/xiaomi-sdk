## iZooto Native Android PowerPush Notification Plugin

[iZooto](https://www.izooto.com) provides push notification service for mobile apps. This plugin makes it easy to implement push notifications on your Android app built on the Native framework and provides enhanced deliveries with Xiaomi and Huawei Messaging Services.

iZooto can send push notifications powered by Xiaomi Cloud Push for Xiaomi branded devices and Huawei Messaging Service for Huawei branded devices. These are Android push notification delivery services for Chinese devices, and the OEM has a higher regard for their own push notification service as compared to FCM.
